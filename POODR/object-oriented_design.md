# Object-Oriented Design

The world is procedural. Time flows and events pass by one by one. Activities can be modeled using procedural software. The order is known so everything can be writen in code.

-- example --

The world is object-oriented. There are objects around us that we can interact with. Each object has its own behavior. Some interactions between objects might be predictable, others are not.

-- example -- 

In a world of objects, new arrangements of behavior emerge naturally. Object-oriented design requires you to shift your thinking of the world as a collection of predefined procedures to modeling the world as a series of messages that pass between objects.

## In Praise of Design

Software gets build for a reason. The target application is the entire point. If programming was painful to produce cost-effective software, programmers would all find other jobs.

When writing software, you do not have to choose between pleasure and productivity. Programming techniques that make code a joy to write, overlap with those that most efficiently produces software. 

Object-oriented design solves both the moral and technical dilemmas of programming. Using an object-oriented approach produces cost effective software using code dat is a pleasure to write.
